We had the great pleasure of spending some time with the crowd of Rust & Tell today. At the meetup, we got the chance to share some of the stories of tremor and Event Processing Cartography. Long story short, if you're curious, the talk was recorded (we'll add the link later), and we got [the slides](/slides/2020-03-31-RustAndTellBerlin-functions.pdf) right here!
